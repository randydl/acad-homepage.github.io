# 😺 About Me
I am currently pursuing my M.Phil. degree in the field of Computer Science at the [University of Sydney (悉尼大学)](https://sydney.edu.au), where I have been enrolled since 2022. Under the guidance of [Prof. Tongliang Liu (刘同亮)](https://tongliang-liu.github.io), I am conducting research on robust deep learning techniques capable of effectively handling imperfect data. This includes scenarios involving data corruption, limited supervision, and small datasets. Additionally, I am investigating the practical applications of these techniques in the field of medical image diagnosis.

My journey commenced upon graduating in 2016 with a B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the [Civil Aviation University of China (中国民航大学)](https://www.cauc.edu.cn), where I had the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Hongying Zhang (张红颖)](https://www.cauc.edu.cn/ddxy/info/1188/1516.htm). Throughout my career, I have successfully delivered a variety of projects utilizing programming languages such as C/C++, Python, and JavaScript. This experience has helped me develop proficiency in these programming languages as well as gain a strong understanding of software design patterns. I also have actively contributed to several computer vision projects, including the development of systems for detecting pulmonary nodules, identifying intracranial hemorrhages, and detecting rib fractures, among others. These projects have allowed me to leverage my expertise in computer vision and continually enhance my skills in this exciting field.
