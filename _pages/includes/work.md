# ðŸ’¼ Employments

- *2021.07 - 2022.09*, [**Shukun Technology**](https://shukun.net)
  - Involved in developing a clinical detection system for [Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH)](images/ich.png) based on deep learning technology, which could automatically process images and assess them for hemorrhage within minutes. Trained with thousands of non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans from several hospitals, the system could identify all types of suspected hemorrhage, including intraparenchymal (IPH), intraventricular (IVH), subdural (SDH), epidural (EDH) and subarachnoid (SAH), with a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 94% and segmentation Dice coefficient of 88%. In clinical practice, it could really help doctors streamline decision-making and expedite patient care.

- *2019.08 - 2021.06*, [**Dianei Technology**](https://dianei-ai.com)
  - Developed a clinically applicable automatic deep learning system for rib fractures detection from CT scans, which achieved a high sensitivity of 92.9% with an average of 5.27 false positives per scan and reduced approximate 86% clinical time consuming. A paper was published in [eBioMedicine (by The Lancet)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(20)30482-5/fulltext). A subset of the dataset was open-source to research community, which was the first open large-scale dataset in this application, and we successfully hosted [MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge](https://ribfrac.grand-challenge.org).
  - Developed a solution of 2D+1D CNN in Kaggle competition of RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection, which ranked top 8% among more than 1345 teams in 75 countries.

- *2017.04 - 2019.07*, [**SAP Labs China**](https://www.sap.cn/index.html)
  - Involved in developing Pulmonary Nodule Detection system named [Argus](images/argus.mp4), responsible for designing false positive reduction model. Due to the limited size of the segmentation model structure and insufficient random negative samples, the morphological differences between the false detection areas and nodules couldn't be fully learned by the segmentation model. Therefore, I designed multimodal fusion to reduce misdiagnosis rate. Finally, the system achieved a high detection sensitivity of 96% with an average 5 false positives per case.
  - Involved in developing SAP core web framework [SAPUI5](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com) by JavaScript, CSS and HTML5, responsible for designing crucial [Gantt Chart](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.gantt.simple.GanttChartWithTable/sample/sap.gantt.sample.GanttChart2WithLines) control as core developer.

- *2016.07 - 2017.03*, [**Honeywell Aerospace**](https://aerospace.honeywell.com.cn)
  - Involved in developing the [Cockpit Flight Instrument](images/airplane.jpg) display system by C/C++ for Boeing company, which was used to display various flight parameters of aircraft graphically.
